- potions and / or spells with horrible side effects

Something related to physics
- "unstable" ~= radioactive

Unstable connection
- set up some kind of 5g outposts to spread 'rona around
- start by having you network connection go boom, you decide to put up your own towers

Unstable = horjuva/hutera

Summary of all of this shit. "Everything is unstable"

  outdoors to go set up networks towers. Minigame: climb up a horjuva tower

========================================

### Gameplay:
- 2D spoopy story-driven atmospheric horror game
- side-scroller (?)
- toggleable insanity (?)
  - toggleable with keybind (?)
  - toggleable with phobias (?)
- sanity meter (?)
  - some things increase sanity, some decrease
  - items do alternative things based on sanity level (?)
- Sneaking (?)

### Theme
- "Mentally unstable"
- Main character has fears/phobias/etc.
- Unsettling "ghosts"
- 

### Random ideas for events
- Equipment goes kaput and makes noise. Noise attracts nasties
- "Wrong choices" with hiding spots
  - skelly in a closet. Jumpscare + no u really don't want to hide in this closet
- scratch marks in closets: not safe to hide in here

### Lore
- Journalist goes to investigate the lair of a suspicious mad scientist and gets chased by spoopy science experiments haha sus
- just a guy trying to survive a night in his apartment. because he is unstable the apartment starts to look like a spoopy mansion/other place (?)
- guy goes to mansion with his buddies and gets lost. he thinks his buddies get murdered, but in reality they are the "monsters" that search for him (?)

### Special effects:
- if going with sanity thing, low sanity = music changes (slow down/change pitch), maybe visual effects too
-
